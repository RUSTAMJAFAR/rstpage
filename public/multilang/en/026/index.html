<h1>mirror’s edge: the conglomerate</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>i found it interesting the openning speech of protagonist in mirror’s edge
video game. below is the partial transcript:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>once, the city used to pulse with energy. dirty and dangerous, but alive
and wonderful. now it’s something else. the changes came slowly at first.
most did not realize or did not care, and accepted them. they chose a
comfortable life. some didn’t. …​ and those who refused to conform were
pushed to the sideline…​ criminalized. …​</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the general setting is elaborated in the second part of the video game:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>in the city of glass the conglomerate rules supreme. all regular citizens
have been made willing slaves, lured into an endless race for status and
wealth. but some choose to live off the grid. …​ as long as they don’t
openly challange the authorities, the conglomerate turns a blind eye. …​</p>
</div>
