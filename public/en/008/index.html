<h1>git: commit identity</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>usually, i don’t use graphical user interface when working w/ git repos, and all of my work is
happening in terminal. the same w/ github web page, i rarely visit it.
one day, i decided to do so, to see how things are
going there, and discovered that on my github landing page there was no
any single commit that i had been doing through time. actually, when going into
the repos, all of the commits were listed, but…​</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>googling this issue, i’ve found that <strong>git</strong> tracks commits based on their
<strong>author</strong> and <strong>committer</strong> emails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the question is who is the author and who is the committer?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>an <strong>author</strong> is one who creates a patch file. patch file is, as i get it,
basically, a list of files and changes that will be included in next
commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>a <strong>committer</strong> is one who makes a patch file one step further into a commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the same w/ books. a writer is an author of a book. but a book can have
completely different publisher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>then i remembered, that i’ve changed my github email address last month, and
not having this change reproduced in my local config file</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_github">github</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>github hosting service treats commit as <strong>yours</strong> if its [commit’s] <strong>author email</strong> is
same w/ your <strong>github account email</strong>. no matter who the committer was, if it
has <strong>author email</strong> matched w/ you <strong>github account email</strong> then you’re <strong>the author</strong> and
the commit will be displayed on your github landing page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>thus, when i’ve changed my github email address, i lost ownership of all of my past
commits at once.</p>

<h3 id="_check_git_configurations">check <code>git</code> configurations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>first of all, once you are in your git repo, it is good to check user name and
email w/ the following cmds:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>git config --&lt;global | local&gt; --list | grep user</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>i <strong>strongly</strong> recommend you to set git user name and email on you machine
before you start any work w/ the repo,
cause this will get you rid of many troubles hereafter. do this w/ the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>git config --&lt;global | local&gt; user.name &#34;&lt;your-name&gt;&#34;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git config --&lt;global | local&gt; user.name &#34;&lt;your-email&gt;&#34;</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>starting from here, your future commits will have both <strong>author email</strong> and <strong>commit
email</strong> the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_check_commits_author_and_committer">check commit’s author and committer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>already having commits in your repo, you can check who is the author and the
committer w/:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git cat-file -p &lt;commit&gt;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>again, for github to treat the commit as yours, <strong>author email</strong> has to match w/
<strong>github account email</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_changing_author_email">changing <strong>author email</strong></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>in my case, i wanted to change commits&#39; author name. some googling, and i’ve
done this w/ the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>git rebase -r --root --exec \
&#39;git commit --amend --no-edit --author=&#34;your-name &lt;your-email&gt;&#34;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>this introduces completely new commits w/ new sha-hashes. in fact, only your
<strong>account email</strong> will be changed. in order for <strong>commit email</strong> to be changed, you
have to make sure that you’ve configured <code>--&lt;global | local&gt;</code> name and
email address before executing this command.</p>
