<p>i think, this is the first thing you have to consider when starting something
new. this doesn’t matter your color, your ethnic background, your social
status or your education. this will definitely help you to set the direction
of your journey through life.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>below are some questions, i think, everyone should ask themselves:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>why do i start doing what i start to do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who will benefit from what i start to do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what will the future look like?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>for sure, each of us will have different answers on these questions, based on
our values. but, here is the thing. each individual will have noticed his/her
answers change while growing as a person. so ask yourself these questions
frequently, for it will help you to adjust the direction.</p>
