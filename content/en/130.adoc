> Be honest and true, boys!
> Whatever you do, boys,
> Let this be your motto through life.
> Both now and forever,
> Be this your endeavor,
> When wrong with the right is at strife.
>
> The best and the truest,
> Alas! are the fewest;
> But be one of these if you can.
> In duty ne’er fail; you
> Will find ’twill avail you,
> And bring its reward when a man.
>
> Don’t think life plain sailing;
> There’s danger of failing,
> Though bright seem the future to be;
> But honor and labor,
> And truth to your neighbor,
> Will bear you safe over life’s sea.
>
> Then up and be doing,
> Right only pursuing,
> And take your fair part in the strife.
> Be honest and true, boys,
> Whatever you do, boys,
> Let this be your motto through life!
