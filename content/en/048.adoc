here i explain how i use colours in vim

## custom colorscheme

to maintain my own colorscheme in vim i use _lifepillar/vim-colortemplate_,
https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate.

show current buffer highlight groups:

[source,]
----
:hi[ghlight]
----

show color group under cursor in vim w/:

[source,]
----
:execute 'hi' synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 1), "name")
----

when setting colors for specific color group, specify it for both light and
dark variants of the colorscheme. TODO: elaborate on this.

## colors in my life

in general, i try to use as few colours as possible. so i try to stick
to the basic 16 colours in my vim colorscheme.

there's a good website,
https://www.hashemian.com/tools/html-css-color-test.htm, that will help you
to quickly check how the colours you choose will look in an html page.
