# WINDOWS: APPS I USE
:showtitle:

FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE I'VE BEEN USING MACOS. NOW, WITH MY
CAREER SHIFTING MORE INTO ENGINEERING, I'VE PURCHASED MS SURFACE MACHINE, WHICH
MAKES ME SPEND MORE TIME USING WINDOWS OS. HERE I'LL POST SOME APPLICATIONS
THAT I FIND REALLY USEFULL.

* POWERTOYS, https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys
* WINSCP, https://winscp.net/
* SOURCETREE, https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
* NOTEPADD++, https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

THIS LIST IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE

TODO: I'LL SHARE MY EXPREIENCE OF USING MAC OS AND WINDOWS OS IN A
SEPARATE POST.
