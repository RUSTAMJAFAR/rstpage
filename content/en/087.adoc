:showtitle:

by default, khan academy uses youtube player to play its videos, but
you can disable this behaviuor by doing the following:

> At the end of a video's link right after `?modal=1â€”`, add this string:
> `&disable_youtube=1`. By doing this, YouTube will be blocked and the
> fallback player will be triggered. In case the video's link ends in anything
> that's not `?modal=1`, add `?modal=1&disable_youtube=1` instead.
