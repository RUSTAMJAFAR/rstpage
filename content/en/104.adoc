# DO NOT DISCREDIT YOURSELF
:showtitle:

BELOW I WILL POST EXCERPTS FROM 2020 TRUMP'S 60 MUNIUTE INTERVIEW.
I KNOW WHO THE INTERVIEWER WAS, BUT HONESTLY, I JUST DON'T WANT HER NAME TO
BE POSTED ON MY SITE. THAT'S WHY I'ILL JUST USE THE WORD "INTERVIEWER"
INSTEAD.

> ...
>
> <INTERVIEWER>: (23:10) Do you think that your tweets and your name
> calling are turning people off?
>
> Donald Trump: (23:18) No, I think I wouldn't be here if I didn't have
> social media, because the media is corrupt. In my opinion, the media
> is corrupt. But the media is fake, and frankly, if I didn't have social media,
> I'd have no way of getting out my voice.
>
> <INTERVIEWER>: (23:35) You know what you told me a long time ago when I
> asked why you keep saying fake, with the media?
>
> Donald Trump: (23:39) Yeah.
>
> <INTERVIEWER>: (23:39) You said to me, "I say that because I need to
> discredit you, so that when you say negative things about me, no one will
> believe you."
>
> Donald Trump: (23:48) I don't have to discredit you.
>
> <INTERVIEWER>: (23:48) But that's what you told me.
>
> Donald Trump: (23:51) You've discredited yourself.
>
> <INTERVIEWER>: (23:52) You told me that.
>
> Donald Trump: (23:53) <INTERVIEWER>, you've discredited yourself. When you say
> that you're not going to cover Biden, you're going to ask him what flavor
> ice cream he has, okay.
>
> <INTERVIEWER>: (24:02) That's not me.
>
> Donald Trump: (24:03) Instead of, "Why did Hunter get three and a half
> million dollars from Moscow?" Instead of, "Why is an energy company
> paying your son $183,000 a month, or whatever they're paying him?"
> And he has no experience in energy. You discredit yourself. I don't
> have to discredit you
>
> ...

FINALLY MR. PRESIDENT PERFECTLY ABRUPTS AN INTERVIEW WITH THE FOLLOWING

> <INTERVIEWER>: (37:13) You're President. You're president-
>
> Donald Trump: (37:13) ... start with me. Excuse me, <INTERVIEWER>.
> You started with me. Your first statement was, "Are you ready for
> tough questions?"
>
> <INTERVIEWER>: (37:21) I did.
>
> Donald Trump: (37:22) That's no way to talk. That's no way to talk.
