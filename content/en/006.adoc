= bash: \`entr` utility
:showtitle:

using `entr` when writing bash scripts is precious. this little utility
**listens for the file you give it to be  modified and executes whatever
it is set to execute**. you can even execute the same file that `entr`
is listening to.

so in my case, as i am not a pro bash script writer, the usage is:

```
$ entr -sc "source <file_to_execute>" <<< $( echo <file_to_listen> )
```

i would also like to point out that there can be completely different
`file_to_execute` and `file_to_listen`.
