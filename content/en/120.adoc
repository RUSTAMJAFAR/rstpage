# MBA: MINDSET
:showtitle:

AS I GET FURTHER  INTO LIFE, I FIND MYSELFT IN A POSITION WHERE I JUST DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO SIMPLE TASKS. SO, I WOULD RATHER PAY SOMETHING FOR
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN

THIS IS A SIMPLE MBA MINDSET THAT I HAVE READ MANY TIMES OVER. BUT DEFINTELY
HAS TO GET ITS PLACE AMONG MY NOTES TO BE CEMENTED IN MY MIND.

TODO: EXPLAIN THIS.
