# BIRDSEYE: BE SURE HOW YOU BEGIN 
:showtitle:
:hardbreaks:

> "When once begun,
> The work's half done,"
> So says the proverb old;
> But even here,
> You'll see it clear,
> The truth is but half told;
> For wisdom says
> There are two ways,
> One loses and one wins;
> You'll find, young friends,
> That all depends
> Upon how one begins.
>
> If wrong begun
> And work half done,
> So much the worse for you;
> If right -- go on
> Until you've won
> The goal you had in view.
> In life you gaze
> Upon the ways
> Of virtue and of sin;
> Be led by truth,
> And in your youth
> Be sure how you begin.
