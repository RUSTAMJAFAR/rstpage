w/ my doctor of medicine degree, i've been admitted to gradute school to get
master's degree in petroleum engineering (more about this background later).
so, as i've no undergrad knowledge about this field, i've to catch up my fellow
students fast. thus searching inside petro industry i think one good resource
that vastly covers this field is https://www.spe.org/en/ website. they also
offer wikipage based on their petroleum engineering handbook located at
https://petrowiki.spe.org/PetroWiki.

below are my own notes that help to orgranize the content on this wiki.

== general engineering

. mathematics of vibrating systems
. mathematics of fluid flow
. mathematics of transient analysis
. fluid sampling
. gas properties
. oil system correlations
. thermodynamics and phase behavior
. phase diagrams
. asphaltenes and waxes
. properties of produced water
. phase behavior of h~2~o + hydrocarbon systems
. crude oil emulsions
. rock properties
. single-phase permeability
. relative permeability and capillary pressure
. petroleum economics
. international oil and gas law
. the 21st century energy mix

== drilling engineering

. geomechanics applied to drilling engineering
. drilling fluids
. fluid mechanics for drilling
. well control: procedures and principles
. introduction to roller-cone and polycrystalline diamond drill bits
. directional drilling
. casing design
. introduction to wellhead systems
. cementing
. drilling problems and solutions
. introduction to well planning
. underbalanced drilling
. emerging drilling technologies
. offshore drilling units
. drilling-data acquisition
. coiled-tubing well intervention and drilling operations

== faculties and construction engineering

== production operations engineering

== reservoir engineering and petrophysics

== emerging peripheral technologies

== index and standards
