# TOGGLING CAPS LOCK
:showtitle:

WHILE WATCHING TRUMP'S NBC INTERVIEW, I DECIDED TO TURN ON SUBTITLES TO LEARN
SOME NEW VOCABULARY. I NOTICED THAT THESE SUBTITLES WERE WRITTEN IN CAPS-LOCKED
MODE. HONESTLY, I LOVED IT AND WILL BE USING CAPS LOCK LETTERS IN MY DAILY
LIFE.

BELOW IS TRUMP'S INTERVIEW

TODO: ELABORATE ON THIS (DON'T FORGET LINUX IS CASE-SENSITIVE)
