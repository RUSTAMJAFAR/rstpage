= rwxrob: don't quit your job
:showtitle:

in this video, https://youtu.be/hHaH0SChHzw, rwxrob says that you shouldn't
quit while taking his beginner boost course.

there's also a good comment i agree with from user @sp123

> Its better to try with obstacles to see if you actually enjoy it.
> Someone quitting their job then realizing they dont like it caused
> themselves unnecessary pain

what i would add is that if you want to start smth new, first try
to balance your work and study, maybe work part time or schedule your
study time after hours, if neither helps, choose the one that matters
most to you.
