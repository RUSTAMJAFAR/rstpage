# O'NEIL: THE FOGGY DEW
:showtitle:
:hardbreaks:

ONE OF THE IRELAND'S REBEL POEMS.

> As down the glen one Easter morn to a city fair rode I
> There Armed lines of marching men in squadrons passed me by
> No pipe did hum no battle drum did sound its loud tattoo
> But the Angelus Bell o'er the Liffey's swells rang out in the foggy dew
>
> Right proudly high in Dublin Town hung they out a flag of war
> 'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud-El-Bar
> And from the plains of Royal Meath strong men came hurrying through
> While Britannia's Huns, with their long range guns sailed in through the foggy dew
>
> 'Twas England bade our wild geese go, that small nations might be free
> Their lonеly graves are by Suvla's waves or thе fringe of the great North Sea
> Oh, had they died by Pearse's side or fought with __Cathal Brugha__
> Their names we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the shroud of the foggy dew
>
> Their bravest fell, and the Requiem bell rang mournfully and clear
> For those who died that Eastertide in the springing of the year
> While the world did gaze, with deep amaze, at those fearless men, but few
> Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the foggy dew
>
> And back through the glen I rode again, my heart with grief was sore
> For I parted then with valiant men whom I shall never see n'more
> But to and fro in my dreams I go and I kneel and pray for you
> For slavery fled, O glorious dead, when you fell in the foggy dew
