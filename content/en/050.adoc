= git: reset
:showtitle:

a few notes for myself in regards to what is said in the title

* head
* index
* working tree

== soft reset

`*git reset --soft <commit-name>*`

simply moves _head_ to `<commit-name>`, _index_ and _working tree_ are intact.
this one is same as:

`git commit --ammend`

== mixed reset

`*git reset --mixed <commit-name>*`

updates _index_ with whatever `<commit-name>` _head_ points to, _working tree_
is intact.

== hard reset

`*git reset --hard <commit-name>*`

updates _head_, _index_ and _working tree_ w/ whatever `<commit-name>` _head_
points to.
