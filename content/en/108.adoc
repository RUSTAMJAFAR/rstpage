# WEBSITE: WORKFLOW
:showtitle:

AS OF 20240518114611, I'VE MOVED MY ENTIRE WEBSITE TO HUGO.
I'VE SET IT UP, CREATED TEMPLATES AND STYLES TO BE USED W/ THEM.
AND IN GENERAL, I LOVE HUGO. IT IS A REALLY COOL TOOL TO USE IF YOU
BUILD WEBSITES ON A REGULAR BASIS.

BUT THE THING IS, I'M PURSUING MASTER'S IN ENGINEERING, not in cs. i study
engineering a lot, and everything associated w/ it. still i try to
manage my notes, i use every tool possible to jot them down whenever and
wherever i am.
