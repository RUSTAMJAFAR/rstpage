# CLI VS GUI
:showtitle:

WE CAN USE COMPUTER SOFTWARE IN TWO WAYS. THE FIRST IS THE COMMAND LINE
INTERFACE, CLI. THE SECOND IS THROUGH THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE, GUI. USING SOFTWARE
THROUGH CLI REQUIRES YOU TO TYPE EACH COMMAND AND ITS AVAILABLE OPTION EACH
TIME YOU WANT TO RUN SOMETHING. THIS TAKES TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, WITH GUI,
YOU JUST CLICK A BUTTON WITH YOUR MOUSE TO RUN THE COMMAND YOU WANT, AND
THAT'S IT. THIS SAVES A LOT OF TIME. BUT WHEN WRITING SOFTWARE, IT IS
DIFFICULT TO MAKE EVERY CLI COMMAND AVAILABLE IN GUI. SO USING GUI INSTEAD
OF CLI WILL LIMIT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APPLICATION FROM ONE SIDE, BUT
WILL MAKE YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
