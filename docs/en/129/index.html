<h1>O’NEIL: THE FOGGY DEW</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ONE OF THE IRELAND’S REBEL POEMS.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As down the glen one Easter morn to a city fair rode I<br/>
There Armed lines of marching men in squadrons passed me by<br/>
No pipe did hum no battle drum did sound its loud tattoo<br/>
But the Angelus Bell o’er the Liffey’s swells rang out in the foggy dew</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right proudly high in Dublin Town hung they out a flag of war<br/>
&#39;Twas better to die &#39;neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud-El-Bar<br/>
And from the plains of Royal Meath strong men came hurrying through<br/>
While Britannia’s Huns, with their long range guns sailed in through the foggy dew</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#39;Twas England bade our wild geese go, that small nations might be free<br/>
Their lonеly graves are by Suvla’s waves or thе fringe of the great North Sea<br/>
Oh, had they died by Pearse’s side or fought with <em>Cathal Brugha</em><br/>
Their names we’d keep where the Fenians sleep, &#39;neath the shroud of the foggy dew</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their bravest fell, and the Requiem bell rang mournfully and clear<br/>
For those who died that Eastertide in the springing of the year<br/>
While the world did gaze, with deep amaze, at those fearless men, but few<br/>
Who bore the fight that freedom’s light might shine through the foggy dew</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And back through the glen I rode again, my heart with grief was sore<br/>
For I parted then with valiant men whom I shall never see n’more<br/>
But to and fro in my dreams I go and I kneel and pray for you<br/>
For slavery fled, O glorious dead, when you fell in the foggy dew</p>
</div>
