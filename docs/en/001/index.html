<p>i think, that’s the first thing you have to consider when starting something
new. this doesn’t matter your color, your ethnic background, your social
status or your education. this will definitely help you to set the direction
of your journey through life.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>the following are a few questions that i think, everyone should ask themselves:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>why do i start doing what i start to do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who will benefit from what i start to do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what will the future look like?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>sure, each of us will have different answers to these questions, based on
our values. but, here is the thing. each of us will have noticed that our
answers change as we grow as a person. so ask yourself these questions
frequently, for it will help you to adjust your direction.</p>
