i think, that’s the first thing you have to consider when starting something new. this doesn’t matter your color, your ethnic background, your social status or your education. this will definitely help you to set the direction of your journey through life.
the following are a few questions that i think, everyone should ask themselves:

/usr/sbin/sshd and then
systemctl start sshd
you get inactive as the response. so, to start server system-wide just run the following command:
systemctl start &amp;lt;sshd | ssh&amp;gt; now, after running system status sshd command, you’ll find its status changed to active.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/003/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/003/</guid><description>sample dbs following is the list of sample databases to use to improve your excel, sql, etc., skills.

issue the thing w/ installing tex distribution through ubuntu repositories, such as apt, apt-get, etc., is that you won’t be able to manage stand-alone tex packages later as needed.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LaTeX
so, for you to install single tex package you first have to check in which ubuntu package it is located, through apt-cache search &amp;lt;tex-package-name&amp;gt;, and then install that ubuntu package which in turn contains other unnecessary tex packages that you don’t need right now, thus taking free space on you machine.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/021/</guid><description>physics: beginner’s guide here’s a link for everyone starting learning physics

If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too: If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, Or being hated don’t give way to hating, And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/050/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/050/</guid><description>git: reset a few notes for myself in regards to what is said in the title
head
index
working tree
soft reset git reset --soft &amp;lt;commit-name&amp;gt;
simply moves head to &amp;lt;commit-name&amp;gt;, index and working tree are intact. this one is same as:
git commit --ammend
mixed reset git reset --mixed &amp;lt;commit-name&amp;gt;
updates index with whatever &amp;lt;commit-name&amp;gt; head points to, working tree is intact.
hard reset git reset --hard &amp;lt;commit-name&amp;gt;
updates head, index and working tree w/ whatever &amp;lt;commit-name&amp;gt; head points to.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/051/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/051/</guid><description>petro: wiki general engineering drilling engineering faculties and construction engineering production operations engineering reservoir engineering and petrophysics emerging peripheral technologies index and standards w/ my specialist’s degree in medicine, i’ve been admitted to graduate school to get master’s degree in petroleum engineering (more on this background later). so as i have no undergraduate knowledge in this field, i need to catch up my fellow students quickly. thus searching inside the petro industry i think one good resource that extensively covers this field is the spe website https://www.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/052/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/052/</guid><description>math: greek alphabet you definitely need this one if you’re a part of math community</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/053/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/053/</guid><description>math: calculus there’s a very good explanation on reddit by u/Dr0110111001101111 https://www.reddit.com/user/Dr0110111001101111/ about stewart’s calculus: early transcendentals
Early Transcendentals is the way to go. This is the book that made James Stewart a very wealthy guy.
Prior to Stewart writing that book, virtually every calculus book used a sequence that is now known as &amp;#34;late transcendentals&amp;#34;. They didn’t have a term for it back then, because they didn’t need one. It was the only way to go.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/054/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/054/</guid><description>linux: time zone all the info is available at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_time. below are the commands i used in my personal case.

thanks to https://simpliengineering.com/t/origin-of-trig-terms-tangent-and-secant/1886
there’s also a good comment following by the user BAretired:
I love that diagram of a circle of unit radius. It makes everything so clear and actually gives us a rough idea of approximately what size the various trig functions should be.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rustamjafar.com/en/057/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rustamjafar.com/en/057/</guid><description>clothes: standards clearly explainded standards for men’s apparel
