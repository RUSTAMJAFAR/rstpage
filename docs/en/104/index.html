<h1>DO NOT DISCREDIT YOURSELF</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BELOW I WILL POST EXCERPTS FROM 2020 TRUMP’S 60 MUNIUTE INTERVIEW.
I KNOW WHO THE INTERVIEWER WAS, BUT HONESTLY, I JUST DON’T WANT HER NAME TO
BE POSTED ON MY SITE. THAT’S WHY I’ILL JUST USE THE WORD &#34;INTERVIEWER&#34;
INSTEAD.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>…​</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;INTERVIEWER&gt;: (23:10) Do you think that your tweets and your name
calling are turning people off?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donald Trump: (23:18) No, I think I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t have
social media, because the media is corrupt. In my opinion, the media
is corrupt. But the media is fake, and frankly, if I didn’t have social media,
I’d have no way of getting out my voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;INTERVIEWER&gt;: (23:35) You know what you told me a long time ago when I
asked why you keep saying fake, with the media?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donald Trump: (23:39) Yeah.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;INTERVIEWER&gt;: (23:39) You said to me, &#34;I say that because I need to
discredit you, so that when you say negative things about me, no one will
believe you.&#34;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donald Trump: (23:48) I don’t have to discredit you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;INTERVIEWER&gt;: (23:48) But that’s what you told me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donald Trump: (23:51) You’ve discredited yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;INTERVIEWER&gt;: (23:52) You told me that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donald Trump: (23:53) &lt;INTERVIEWER&gt;, you’ve discredited yourself. When you say
that you’re not going to cover Biden, you’re going to ask him what flavor
ice cream he has, okay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;INTERVIEWER&gt;: (24:02) That’s not me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donald Trump: (24:03) Instead of, &#34;Why did Hunter get three and a half
million dollars from Moscow?&#34; Instead of, &#34;Why is an energy company
paying your son $183,000 a month, or whatever they’re paying him?&#34;
And he has no experience in energy. You discredit yourself. I don’t
have to discredit you</p>

You started with me. Your first statement was, &#34;Are you ready for
tough questions?&#34;</p>
