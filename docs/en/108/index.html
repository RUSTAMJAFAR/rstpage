<h1>WEBSITE: WORKFLOW</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AS OF 20240518114611, I’VE SET HUGO UP AND I’VE MOVED MY ENTIRE WEBSITE THERE.
YOU CAN READ ABOUT MY PREVIOUS WORKFLOW IN THE NOTE BY REFERENCING MENTIONED
ID. IN GENERAL, I LOVE HUGO. IT IS A REALLY COOL TOOL TO USE IF YOU
BUILD WEBSITES ON A REGULAR BASIS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BUT THE THING IS, I DON’T USE IT IN THE WAY DESCRIBED ABOVE.
I’M PURSUING MASTER’S IN ENGINEERING, NOT IN CS. I STUDY
ENGINEERING A LOT, INCLUDING EVERYTHING THAT GOES W/ IT. SOMEHOW I MANAGE TO
KEEP MY NOTES BY USING EVERY TOOL AVAILABLE TO WRITE THEM DOWN WHEREVER AND
WHENEVER I AM (MORE ON THIS LATER). IT TAKES TIME FOR ME TO UPLOAD
THEM TO THE INTERNET. BASICALLY, I SET ONE DAY
ASIDE TO DO THIS. HUGO ITSELF ASSUMES YOU’RE USING IT IN TERMINAL
(I LOVE IT). IT HAPPENS THAT  WHEN I COME BACK TO MY TERMINAL WINDOW,
I COMPLETELY FORGET WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT HUGO AND SPEND SOME TIME
RELEARNING IT. IT TAKES TIME AND I DON’T REGRET IT. BUT
EVERY TIME I DO SO, I THINK THERE’RE LANGUAGES I LOVE THAT I COULD HAVE
SPENT TIME LEARNING INSTEAD OF HUGO, FOR HUGO IS NOT A
LANGUAGE, IT’S A FRAMEWORK. THESE LANGUAGES INCLUDE BASH, C, AND GO.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HAVING SAID ALL THAT, I’M THINKING OF CHANGING THE CURRENT WORKFLOW. I DON’T
KNOW WHERE IT WILL TAKE THE NEXT ITERATION OF MY WEBSITE, BUT WE’LL SEE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>THANK’S FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS. AND LET’S GET TO WORK.</p>
