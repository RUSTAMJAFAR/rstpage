<h1>handling charity</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>in today’s world there’re plenty of donating strategies to use. for now i will
consider giving to a charity in terms of how much money to donate, and <strong>not</strong>
who should be the recipient of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>so, these strategies include: creating different calendars, including
payments frequency, amounts of wealth to be given keeping in my mind different
types of social classes, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>i encourage any people who give to a charity, no matter what the social
class is. so it is comfortable to donate when you find yourself in the uppers
levels of social classes, but what about those who are not, for being in the
low social classes makes you to count every coin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>in my opinion, no matter what the social class is, the only donating strategy
to work is <strong>percentage</strong>. thus <strong>giving a small defined fraction of all your
earnings</strong> makes the situation even.</p>
