creator of rawgit, final letter</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RawGit is now in a sunset phase and will soon shut down. It’s been a fun
five years, but all things must end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub repositories that served content through RawGit within the last month
will continue to be served until at least October of 2019. URLs for other
repositories are no longer being served.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re currently using RawGit, please stop using it as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why this is happening</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RawGit has always been a small hobby project. I’ve never been able to spend
more than a handful of minutes a week on it, but it achieved a degree of
popularity I could never have imagined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last month alone RawGit served over 4.2 billion requests and consumed more
than 176 terabytes of bandwidth. Those numbers are simply unfathomable to me.
They’re almost too huge to be real.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, RawGit has also become an attractive distribution mechanism
for malware. RawGit was meant to improve people’s lives, but jerks are
increasingly using it to hurt people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt;Since I have almost no time to devote to fighting malware and abuse on RawGit
(and since it would be no fun even if I did have the time), I feel the
responsible thing to do is to shut it down. I would rather kill RawGit than
watch it be used to hurt people</p>
